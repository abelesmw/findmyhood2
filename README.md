# findmyhood2
Find My Hood is iOS App that displays your current neighborhood by using the Google Maps API to parse the "neighborhood" field using current lat & lon. For travelers and city-dwellers, it can be hard to tell what actual neighbhorhood you're currently in using Google or Apple maps. 
For example, you might be on the west side of Manhattan at a restaurant, but it's hard to tell if you're in the West Village or in Chelsea. It can be fun to grab this neighborhood with a quick tap of a button while you're visiting a new area or traveling to brand new city.

I call it Find My Hood 2 since this is an app I actually previous built back in 2016, but I missed it now that it was no longer up to date with the current app store requirement so I re-built it.
